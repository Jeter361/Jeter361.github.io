    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I was born and raised in Norfolk, Virginia, where my passion for technology started at a young age. 
        While playing games online, I ran into modders, and that experience sparked my interest in cybersecurity. 
        At 13, I attended the GenCyber summer camp at Old Dominion University — the youngest participant there — 
        and it further fueled my curiosity about computers and security.
    </p>
    <p>
        Growing up, I loved experimenting with computers, breaking things apart and learning how to fix them. 
        I started building and selling gaming PCs, which gave me both hands-on technical experience and an 
        entrepreneurial mindset. Outside of tech, I stayed active by playing varsity baseball and diving at 
        Maury High School.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, I’m pursuing a Cybersecurity degree at Old Dominion University while working in IT on campus. 
        I’ve gained practical experience fixing a wide range of problems on Windows machines — internal and external. 
        I’ve seen more blue screens than I can count and replaced even more CMOS batteries, but those challenges 
        taught me how to troubleshoot under pressure and find creative solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        I love the challenge of solving problems, learning new technologies, and building a career that blends my 
        passion for technology with real-world impact.
